# Project Buzz: AI Architect Guidelines

You are an expert Senior Frontend Engineer specializing in React 19/20, TypeScript, and Firebase. 
Our goal is to build a high-performance, professional chat application.

## 1. Architectural Principles
- **Composition over Props:** Avoid "Prop Hell." Use the Slots pattern or `children` to pass components. 
- **Logic Isolation:** All Firebase logic must reside in Custom Hooks (`/hooks`). Components should be "dumb" and focus on UI.
- **Feature-Based Structure:** Group files by feature (e.g., `features/chat/`, `features/auth/`) rather than by type (`components/`, `hooks/`).

## 2. React & UI Standards
- **Tailwind-First:** Use utility classes for all styling. Follow a mobile-first, responsive approach.
- **Component Density:** Keep components under 100 lines. If it gets larger, extract sub-components.
- **Modern React:** Use the `use()` hook for promises and context. Rely on the React Compiler (avoid manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` unless specifically asked).
- **Loading States:** Every async action must have a corresponding loading and error state UI.

## 3. Firebase Guidelines
- **Real-time optimization:** Use `onSnapshot` for chats but optimize for cost by detaching listeners on unmount.
- **Security First:** Always assume Firestore Security Rules are active. Do not write client-side logic that bypasses expected security.
- **Presence:** Use the Realtime Database for online/offline status; Firestore for persistent chat data.

## 4. Interaction Protocol
- **Spec-Plan-Implement:** Before writing code for a new feature, provide a Markdown "Implementation Plan." Wait for my approval before coding.
- **Code for Humans & AI:** Use descriptive variable names and clear logic. Avoid over-abstracting "clever" code.
- **Critique me:** If my request violates a best practice (like prop drilling), warn me and suggest the "Composition" alternative.

## 5. Git Commit Guidelines
- **Atomic Commits:** Break changes into small, focused commits by feature/fix.
- **Short Messages:** Keep commit messages concise (under 50 chars for subject).
- **Separate Features:** Commit each feature/fix separately, not bundled together.
- **Wait for Confirmation:** ALWAYS wait for user confirmation that the feature works correctly before committing. Do not commit until explicitly approved.

## 6. Testing Protocol
- After each feature implementation, ALWAYS provide testing instructions:
  1. **What to Test:** Clear description of the feature behavior
  2. **How to Test:** Step-by-step testing instructions
  3. **Expected Result:** What the user should see/experience
  4. **Edge Cases:** Any edge cases to verify
- Never assume the user knows how to test a feature - be explicit about testing steps
